# exchange-rate-api 
This repo source code has intended bugs. To run the server properly, you will have to fix those bugs. Each week I will add new bugs, I believe that the best way to learn how to be a good coder is to handle bugs and fix them, although this repo state that it uses a simple exchange rate api, this is not it's main purpose.

# goals
* Run a simple ExpressJS server with NodeJS.
* Learn how to use a simple GET REST API.

    * #1 port already in use. (EADDRINUSE, Address already in use)
    * #2 more bugs to come soon...
